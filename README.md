# Second-Hand-vehicle-Sales-Analysis
This model is used for second hand vehicles sales analysis based on different categories like year, model, make, etc.
To analyse market trends and preferences I have visualized the data by bar chart
Preprocessing steps used are to only visualize the relation between numerical data by correlation matrix and pairplot
graph by using seaborn in exploratory data analysis to reduce the noise.
Model evaluation is done by calculating the MSE(mean squared error).
